### Implementation Plan

## Project

[My Portfolio Site](https://curriculum.learnersguild.org/Phases/Practice/Modules/Your-Portfolio-Site/)

## Plan

- [ ] Site is hosted (I recommend Heroku or gh-pages)
  - Will use Heroku
  - Review info on [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment) and how to properly host a project
  - Most likely will need to schedule a 1:1 with a coach or SEP to learn how to do this for the first time
- [ ] Site prominently features link to your GitHub
  - Link to [GitHub](https://github.com/NoCodingGenius)
  - Clean up GitHub to include best projects only
- [ ] Site uses a CSS framework
  - Will use [PureCSS](https://purecss.io/)
  - And will be a single page app
- [ ] Site includes blurb / screenshots / links (both to GitHub and live site) to one of your most impressive projects
  - [Roam](https://github.com/NoCodingGenius/roam)
  - Need to host live on Heroku
- [ ] Site includes blurb / screenshots / links (both to GitHub and live site) to another of your most impressive projects
  - Will need to consider which other project I would like to include in Portfolio
  - Will complete this project next week and include in portfolio
- [ ] Site includes blurbs / links to your open source contributions
  - Get advice on which open source projects I can contribute to easily but impressively
  - As of now I have only contributed to simple updates to the Guild's curriculum
- [ ] Site includes social links (like LinkedIn, Twitter, and other places to find you on the internet)
  - Create a social media section or include in footer?
  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/latoya-williams-82a665112/)
  - [Blog](https://steemit.com/@nocodinggenius)
- [ ] Site includes an about page / section with a headshot
  - Create an about section
  - Will include a headshot from GitHub or LinkedIn profile
- [ ] Site includes an about page / section with a bio
  - Include in about section
  - Need to create a bio
  - Will schedule 1:1 time with Rachel to work on a proper "marketing" strategy and look to find details as to what to include in my bio
- [ ] Your GitHub profile page is cleaned up with clear, descriptive READMEs for the projects you are highlighting
  - Narrow down which projects to keep on GitHub
  - Make sure the projects are pinned on my main page of GitHub
  - Make sure that each has a clear and descriptive README.md file
